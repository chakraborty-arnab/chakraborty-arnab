### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

* As a member of Fidelity's AI Center of Excellence, I develop innovative speech and text processing solutions to empower customer support associates. Additionally, as part of the FIWA Investment Office, I drive Fidelity's efforts to help institutional clients research, evaluate, and invest in private alternative assets.

* Concurrently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Software Engineering at Northeastern University, where my research focuses on enhancing and evaluating large language models through prompt engineering, in-context learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, compression techniques, parameter fine-tuning, and model blending.

* Prior to Fidelity, I led a dynamic team of 20+ highly skilled engineers at Quantiphi, building highly scalable, data-intensive applications and services primarily for the retail sector. I have also mentored over 200 campus graduates at Quantiphi in Python programming, machine learning, and data visualization.

In my free time, I enjoy applying my knowledge to algorithmic trading and developing strategies that consistently outperform the market.
