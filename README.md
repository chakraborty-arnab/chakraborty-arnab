### Hey there ğŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Software engineering at Northeastern University.

Simultaneously, I drive Fidelity's efforts to facilitate institutional clients' access, evaluate and invest in private alternative investments. As a part of the Enterprise AI Capabilities team, Iâ€™m developing innovative speech & language processing solutions to empower customer support associates.

Before this, I led a team of 20+ highly skilled engineers at Quantiphi, building highly-scalable, data-intensive applications and services across diverse industries.

I enjoy applying my knowledge to algorithmic trading and developing strategies that consistently outperform the market.
